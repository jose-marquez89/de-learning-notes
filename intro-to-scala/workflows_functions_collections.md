# Workflows, Functions and Collections

## Scripts, Applications and real-world Workflows
- at the command prompt, scala wraps a script in a template and then compiles and executes the program
- scala is a compiled language but there are interpreted language behaviors when you run a script
    - translates source code to something like machine code to create an executable
- the scala interpreter hides compilation from you
- applications are compiled first and then executed

### IDE's 
- IntelliJ IDEA is a good IDE for scala

### Build tools
- "sbt"`
    - simple build tool
    - compiles runs and tests applications
    - you don't have to use for learning but very helpful when you're developing an actual application

### Jupyter
You can use scala in jupyter notebooks with a kernel called [**almond**](https://almond.sh)
