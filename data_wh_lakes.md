# Data Warehousing/Lakes

### Data Lake
- raw data
- cost effective because it doesn't enforce a model
- difficult to analyze because of lack of structure
- It's possible to use machine/deep learning to find patterns
  - usually a last resort
- real-time analytics on big data by data scientists

### Data Warehouse
- Enforces some kind of model
- Usually smaller
- Typically more costly to manipulate
- ad-hoc, read-only queries

### Data Catalogs for DL's
- source of truth
- compensates for lack of structure
- data governance
  - managing the availability, usability, integrity and security of the data
- it's good to not have to rely on a human source of information every time you have a question
